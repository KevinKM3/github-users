What is the convention for naming classes in CSS?
With the increased use of CSS preprocessors such as SASS and methodologies like LESS and BEM or SMACSS it can be a little difficult to agree on the best approach to CSS naming conventions. I like to plan my CSS before writing a lot of code based on the layout and general style I envision. For readability, it is best to have each declaration on a separate line. Use spaces after the selector and before the opening curly braces. Indent for maximum readability.

What is the DOM? Please explain in your own words.
The Document Object Model is what you see on the webpage. It’s basically the structure of the HTML document. We can use javascript to change and manipulate the DOM. The Document can be the actual HTML. Objects are put inside the Document such as html, title, header and body, etc. tags. The Model is how we lay out the structure of the document.

Which one is better: CSS Grid, Flexbox or just plain CSS?
I believe that either the CSS grid or Flexbox is used more than plain CSS. I feel it depends on the situation to determine which is better. Flexbox is used for one dimension when creating a row or a column. Grid can be used when you need to create rows, and columns at the same time. I don’t feel either is better as it ultimately comes down to what you need in your specific project.
